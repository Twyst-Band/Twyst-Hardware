## 10/21/2025 - Created schematics and footprint for Twyst  

I just found out about the Blueprint program and since I've been working for a while on a new project, I thought I could add it here. This is the reason I've added so many hours at once, because I just discovered this program.
This is also my second and my most complicated hardware PCB project ever, so I am open to suggestions and tips on how to improve my device :))

My project consists of a set of wearable devices that contain an ESP32 C3 super mini, a charging module with LIPO batteries, an IMU module with gyroscope and accelerometer (ICM-45686) and a magnetometer (BMM150). All of these modules together are able to detect the moves and pose of the human body. While drifting is a concern, in most similar systems, my algorithm only requires absolute rotations of the bandanas for them to detect if the movements are correct. This will be done using a Kalman filter.

All work was initially done within EasyEDA, later being migrated to KiCad. I only used parts from LCSC so I can order from JLCPCB.

Below, you can see the schematic, footprint and 3D models of the PCB.

## 10/22/2025 - Added round Screen Display to the default module  

My bandana system will be made out of 2 types of bandana, a main bandana and a secondary bandana. While the secondary only contains the schematics already added to this project, the main bandana also contains a few more modules, including a screen, a pulsoximeter and some other components. Today I added the screen.
